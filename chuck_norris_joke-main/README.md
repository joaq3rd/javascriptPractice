# chuck_norris_joke
This project originated from Brad Traversy's "Modern JavaScript From the Beginning Course" on "Asynchronous JavaScript, Ajax &amp; Fetch API" Section. 

Utilizing the "Fetching multiple random jokes" API from https://www.icndb.com/, users will type in a number for how many Chuck Norris jokes to generate, creating a bulleted <li> of each joke generated.
numbers must be passed through the input.

Future version will have a random generator as a caption to a picture of Chuck Norris.
Stay tuned.
