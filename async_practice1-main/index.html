    1. What is the primary difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
        Answer: Asynchronous is a multi-thread operations, meaning multiple operations or programs can run simultaneously while Synchronous will run one operation at a time.
    2. Why is this useful?
        Answer: Asynchronous makes it possible to run programs without freezing the program during
    3. What problems does it solve?


SECTION 1. INTRODUCING ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT
    Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. 
    Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the results.

    Many functions provided by browsers, especially the most interesting ones, can potentially take a long time, and therefore, are asynchronous.
    For Example:
        - Making HTTP requests using fetch()
        - Accessing a user's camera or microphone using getUserMedia()
        - Asking a user to select files using showOpenFilePicker()

    So even though you may not have to implement your own asynchronous functions very often, you are very likely to need to use them correctly.

SECTION 2. SYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING


    const name = 'Miriam';
    const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name}!`;
    console.log(greeting);
    //"Hello, my name is Miriam!"


    ^this code
    1. Declares a string called name
    2. Declares another string called greeting, which uses name
    3. Outputs the greeting to the JavaScript console.

    The browswer effectively steps through the program one line at a time, in the order we wrote it. 
    Each line, the browser waits for the line to finish its work before going to the next line. 
    Each line depends on the preceding line to proceed.

    That makes this a synchronous program. It would still be synchronous even if we called a separate function, likethis
    

    function makeGreeting(name) {
        return `Hello, my name is ${name}!`;
    }

    const name = 'Miriam';
    const greeting = makeGreeting(name);
    console.log(greeting);
    // "Hello, my name is Miriam!"


    makeGreeting() is a synchronous function because the caller has to wait for the function to finish its work and return a value before the caller can continue

SECTION 3. A LONG-RUNNING SYNCHRONOUS FUNCTION
    The basic problem with long-running synchronous functions.
    
    We need the following from our program:
        1. Start a long-running operation by calling a function.
        2. Have that function start the operation and return immediately, so that our program can still be responsive to other events.
        3. Notify us with the result of the operation when it eventually completes.\

    ^This is what ASYNCHRONOUS can do.

SECTION 4. EVENT HANDLERS
    Event handlers are a form of asynchronous programming: 
        you provide a function that will be called when the event happens (onMouseClicked, onKeyClick, etc.)
    
    The XMLHttpRequest API enables you to make HTTP requests to a remote server using JavaScript.
        Attaching an Event Listener to the XMLHttpRequest object notifies about the progress and eventual completion of a request.

    The following example shows this in action.
